### GDP Data Analysis 

#### Project Overview
This project aims to analyze GDP of all the countries over 100 years and derive valuable insights and conclusions.
I have answered the following questions using data analysis and visualizations in Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn): 

1. Which countries currently have the highest and lowest GDP? I will be looking at and comparing GDP growth over the last 100 years for the countries that have been at the top and bottom 5 consistently.<br>
2. Which countries are the fastest growing based on average growth rate for the last 10 years? How has their growth been for the last 100 years? <br>
3. How has USA's GDP growth been? How does it perform compared to the higest performing countries? How does it perform comapared to other countries of interest? <br>

#### Dataset
The data used in this analysis is from Gapminder.(https://www.gapminder.org/data/documentation/gd001/). It can also be downloaded from this repository. 

#### Insights
1. Countries with the highest GDP are Monaco, Luxembourg, Singapore, Ireland and Qatar. Monaco's GDP (214,000) is, by far, the highest. The next is Luxembourg (116,000). These countries also show little volatility. <br>
2. Countries with the lowest GDP are Burundi, South Sudan, Central African Republic, Congo Dem. Rep. and Somalia. The GDPs for these countries are between 705 and 1,140. The line graph also shows extreme volatility in GDP over the last 100 years. Many are lower than what they were 100 years ago. <br>
2. Based on average growth rate for the last 10 years, Guyana is, by far, the fastest growing country with average growth rate of 14.8%, followed by Ireland (8.5%) and China (5.7%). Guyana's growth rate is a little bit more than that of Ireland but Ireland also has one of the highest GDP. <br>
3. USA has had a steady GDP growth over the last 100 years too. USA's GDP in 2022 was 64,599 and the average growth rate for the last 10 years has been 1.55%. <br>
